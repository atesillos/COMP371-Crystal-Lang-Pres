# COMP371-Crystal-Lang-Pres
Comp 371 - Programming languages presentation with examples that can be downloaded and ran!

# Install Crystal
Go to https://crystal-lang.org/ and click install.

Then choose your platform and follow the instructions! Once you have Crystal installed, it is time to create your first file.

# Creating your first file
Creating your first file is easy.

1. Open your terminal to the place you want to create your crystal file
2. With the editor of your choice (I will use vim in this example), type: ```vim HelloWorld.cr```
3. This will open the editor and show you an entirely empty file.
4. The syntax that will print something in termanial is: ```puts "Hello, world!"```
5. Exit your editor and type: ```crytal HelloWorld.cr```
6. This will run the program and print out ```Hello, world!``` right in your terminal!
